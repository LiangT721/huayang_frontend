        How to do inheritance planning? The information mentioned below is
        mostly criticized by many people. But in fact, a perfect tax and
        inheritance plan can be done through trusts and other methods. Because
        most accountants or lawyers are not familiar with trust-related laws,
        most people don’t know those. So, I translate this article. If you are
        interested in it, please keep reading.<br /><br />
        Modern medicine is quite amazing. I think we are approaching the day
        when humans can be cloned. Leaving aside the moral and legal problems
        that this may bring, I can think of many good uses for the second
        "I".<br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        Is it possible that the "cloned me" really likes to take out trash, pick
        up dogs in the backyard, or massage my wife's feet? Or can I program the
        "cloned me" to accomplish these tasks?

        <br /><br />
        "The real me" will work hard to improve my golf game, test various
        beverages and foods, and actively pursue the sleep required for optimal
        functioning. It is a win-win situation for everyone.
        <br /><br />
        Although scientists are still committed to the cloning process, the
        Ministry of Finance was able to clone itself from a tax perspective a
        long time ago.

        I'm talking about Alter ego trust. It's time to rethink this invention.
      </p>
      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1" >Definition</h2>
      <p class="col-10 offset-1">
        Alter ego trust is a trust created after 1999, in which the settlor (the
        person who created the trust) is the only person who is entitled to all
        the income of the trust every year. In addition, no one other than the
        settlor can have the right to trust capital (assets) while he or she is
        still alive. It is possible to establish a "co-partner trust", similar
        to Alter ego trust, partners (married or COMMON LAW, generally refers to
        both spouses) have the right to receive income from the trust every
        year. As long as either of these individuals is alive, they have control
        over the capital in the trust.
      </p>

      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1">Rules</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p class="col-10 offset-1">
        special about Alter ego trust that can transfer assets to the trust and
        will not lead to a tax on profits assets. This is not the same as
        transferring assets to most trusts. <br /><br />
        Now, Alter ego trusts are taxed at the highest marginal tax rate just
        like other inter-vivos trusts. Every year, the trust’s income will be
        taxed in the hands of the settlor, and upon the death of the settlor (or
        the death of the second spouse or partner in the case of a joint partner
        trust), the trust assets will be treated as market value if with capital
        gains, the trust is required to pay relevant taxes at this time. Being
        an Alter ego trust does not provide tax benefits. But there are still
        good reasons to use them.
        </p>
      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1">Benefit</h2>
      <ul class="l1 col-10 offset-1">
          <li class="pb-3">. Avoid the cost of probate. The assets in the Alter ego trust will fall outside the estate at the time of death, thereby avoiding probate costs (if you own assets, such as real estate, you can avoid domestic and foreign probate costs). (Probate fees are collected by the courts of the provinces (except Quebec) to grant "probate" to prove that your will is valid, and the executor has the right to manage the estate.)</li>
          <li class="pb-3">Reduce delays and professional fees. Since the assets in the Alter ego trust will not form part of your deceased property, there will be no delay in preparing for the court to apply for probate or waiting for a court order. The related legal costs can also be avoided. Therefore, you can manage and distribute your assets without these delays and costs.</li>
          <li class="pb-3">Ensure continuity and liquidity. By setting up an Alter ego trust, the trustee will continue to manage assets after the death of the trust founder. There is no change in this regard. This also means that the trustee can convert certain assets into cash at any time, if needed or necessary, to pay taxes or distribute to the heirs, which also avoids the heirs having to pay a large amount of expenses when inheriting the estate.</li>
          <li class="pb-3">Protect privacy. A person’s will will pass probate and it will become a public document. The value of the relevant heritage may also be made public. However, the trust agreement is not public and will protect the privacy of this information.</li>
          <li class="pb-3">Prevent litigation. The terms of the will may be questioned by disgruntled family members or others. Trust agreements are difficult to challenge, so they can also provide greater protection for property distribution.</li>
          <li class="pb-3">Replace (power of attorney) attorney. One advantage of trust over power of attorney is that after death, the trust agreement continues, while power of attorney will not. In addition, trusts are more comprehensive in detailing the specific duties and powers exercised by the trustee. Finally, the trust agreement provides greater protection for the settlor from undue influence from family or friends. The principal is no longer the owner of the asset because they are now controlled by the trustee.</li>

        如何做遗产规划？ 下面提到的信息大多是被很多人诟病的方面。但是其实通过信托和其他方式可以做很完美的税务和遗产计划，由于大多会计或者律师对于信托相关的法律并不熟悉，并不为大多数人所知。所以翻译这篇文章，有兴趣就看看吧。<br /><br />
        现代医学相当惊人。我想我们正在接近可以克隆人类的那一天。撇开这可能带来的道德和法律难题，我可以想到第二个“我”的许多好用途。<br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        是不是“克隆的我”可能真的喜欢拿出垃圾，在后院捡狗，或按摩我妻子的脚？或者我可以为“克隆的我”编程以完成这些任务吗？

        <br /><br />
        “真正的我”将努力改善我的高尔夫球比赛，努力测试各种饮料和食品，并积极追求最佳运作所需的睡眠。对每个人来说都是双赢的。
        <br /><br />
       虽然科学家们仍然致力于克隆过程，但财政部很久以前就可以从税收角度克隆自己。
        <br /><br />
       我在谈论Alter ego 信托。是时候重新审视这项发明了。
      </p>
      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1" >定义</h2>
      <p class="col-10 offset-1">
        Alter ego信托是在1999年之后创建的信托，其中财产授予人（创建信托的人）是每年有权获得信托所有收入的唯一人选。此外，除了财产授予人之外，没有人可以在他或她还活着的时候拥有信托资本（资产）的权利。可以建立一个“共同合作伙伴信托”，与Alter ego 信托相似，合伙人（已婚或COMMON LAW，一般是指夫妻双方）每年都有权获得信托的收入的权利。 只要这俩个人的任何一个还活着时，他们就有对信托中的资本的控制权。
      </p>

      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1">规则</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p class="col-10 offset-1">
        Alter ego 信托的特殊之处在于，可以将资产转移到信托，而不会导致对资产的利得征税。这跟把资产转移到大多数信托的情况不一样。 <br /><br />
       现在，Alter ego 信托的税收就像其他的inter-vivos 信托一样，以最高的边际税率征税。每年，信托的收入将在委托人的手中征税，并且在委托人去世时（或者在共同合伙人信托的情况下第二配偶或伴侣死亡），信托资产将被视作按市场价值处理，如果有资本利得，此信托在此时需要缴纳相关的税款。作为Alter ego 信托并不提供税收优惠。但是仍然有充分的理由使用它们。
        </p>
      <h2 class="col-10 offset-1">好处</h2>
      <ul class="l1 col-10 offset-1">
          <li class="pb-3">避免遗嘱认证费用。在Alter ego信托中的资产将在去世时落在（estate）遗产之外，从而避免遗嘱认证费用（如果您拥有资产，例如房地产，则可以避免国内和国外遗嘱认证费用）。（遗嘱认证费由各省（魁北克省除外）的法院收取，以授予“遗嘱认证”，证明您的遗嘱有效，遗嘱执行人有权管理遗产。）</li>
          <li class="pb-3">减少延误和专业费用。由于Alter ego信托中的资产不会构成您死亡财产的一部分，因此不会因准备法院申请遗嘱认证或等待法院命令而导致延误。同样也可以避免相关的法律费用。因此，您可以在没有这些延迟和成本的情况下管理和分发您的资产。</li>
          <li class="pb-3">确保连续性和流动性。通过设立了Alter ego信托，受托人会在信托创建人去世后继续管理资产。在这方面没有任何变化。这也意味着受托人可以在任何时候，如果需要或必要，将某些资产转换为现金，以支付税款或向继承人分配，这也避免了继承人在继承遗产时候需要支付大笔的费用。</li>
          <li class="pb-3">保护隐私。人的遗嘱将通过遗嘱认证，它就会成为一份公开文件。相关遗产价值也可能公开。但是，信托协议不公开，并将保护此信息的隐私。</li>
          <li class="pb-3">防止诉讼。遗嘱条款可能会被心怀不满的家庭成员或其他人质疑。信托协议很难被挑战，所以也可以为财产分配此提供更大的保护。</li>
          <li class="pb-3">取代 （power of attorney）律师代理（很难翻译）。信托相对于 power of attorney一个优点是，在去世后，信托协议仍在继续，而 power of attorney不会。此外，信托在详细说明受托人行使的具体职责和权力方面更为全面。最后，信托协议为委托人提供更大的保护，防止受到家人或朋友的不当影响。委托人不再是资产的所有者，因为他们现在由受托人控制。</li>
