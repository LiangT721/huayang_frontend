        (This article is adapted from an article by CIBC Bank. It does not
        contain any sophisticated content, but it answers many people’s
        questions. This article does not discuss kiddie tax attribution rule and
        related party asset transfers) <br /><br />
        Most Canadians have considered giving money or other gifts to their
        children. A recent CIBC poll of 3,021 randomly selected Canadian adults
        found that most (76%) Canadian parents gave children 18 years of age or
        older Some financial help will be given to help them move out of the
        house, get married, buy a house, etc.<br /><br />
        However, once you decide to give, the next question is how much you
        should give, what form your gift should take, how much tax, and in some
        cases, family law factors related to gifts need to be considered.<br /><br />Cash
        is probably the most common way of giving gifts, but you can also
        consider giving property in the form of "in kind", for example, giving
        your child a security or house. <br /><br />Canada generally does not
        limit how much you can give. Whether in your life or when you die, you
        can give as much as you can, but you must ensure that the donated
        property is not necessary for your own living or will be used in the
        future asset. After all, the biggest problem with giving gifts is that
        it is difficult to retrieve them. <br /><br />There are two main types
        of gifts: "nter-vivos" gifts, which means gifts given while you are
        alive, or "wills" gifts given after death. By giving gifts, you can
        usually see your beneficiaries enjoy your gifts and may even have an
        opportunity to save taxes.<br /><br />
        Opinion surveys found that many Canadians are confused about taxation
        related to donations. More than half of them admit that they don’t know
        what taxes are on financial gifts to children or relatives. Nearly 10%
        think that gifts are likely to be taxable People tax.
        <br /><br />Although the gift itself is indeed tax-exempt, it is
        important to remember that taxes may be incurred depending on the
        content of the gift. When you donate assets in the form of "in kind",
        such as securities or real estate, you will usually be deemed to have
        sold the gifted property at a fair market price, and you will be taxed
        at 50% of the capital gains.<br /><br />
        Although the gift recipient will not pay any income tax on the gifts
        they receive, he will pay taxes on any future income related to the
        gift. This also provides opportunities for income distribution and tax
        savings for families. For example, suppose you pay taxes at a marginal
        tax rate of 50% and your adult daughter pays taxes at a marginal tax
        rate of 20%. If you give your adult daughter a gift of $100,000 and she
        invests money every year to earn 5% of the income, the total tax savings
        for the family each year may be 1,500 yuan: $100,000 x 5% x (50%-20%
        Minute).<br /><br />
        Please note that the new anti-income distribution rules proposed by
        Finance Minister Bill Morneau do not affect this type of taxation
        plan-parents giving gifts to children over 18 years old. The new rules
        aim to restrict the various income distribution strategies carried out
        by private companies and apply to adult relatives such as siblings,
        children, uncles, aunts or nieces and nephews, etc. <br /><br />Since
        most provinces impose estate management tax or probate fee, up to 1.7%
        of estate assets (depending on your province), gifting can also save you
        some tax. By donating assets, these assets will not be used to calculate
        probate costs because they are not part of your estate.<br /><br />
        When you donate assets directly, you usually lose control of the assets.
        If you want to maintain a certain degree of control over the use of
        assets, you can consider establishing a trust.<br /><br />
        Through a trust, you can transfer assets to a trustee, who will manage
        the assets on behalf of the ultimate beneficiary (usually children,
        family members, etc.). Through the trust agreement, you can specify the
        time and amount of the beneficiary's distribution. This is especially
        useful for beneficiaries who may not be able to manage funds but like to
        spend. Using a trust is more complicated than giving a gift directly.
        You should seek advice from a lawyer or accountant who specializes in
        trusts to determine whether the trust is suitable for you. In some
        cases, a trust may also help protect assets left to the child in the
        future from claims by the child’s current creditors or spouse. In fact,
        if parents want to help their children buy a house but want to protect
        these funds, the parents will structure the "gift" as a loan and require
        the real estate as a mortgage guarantee. This mortgage can be cancelled
        at a later date or upon death.

        关于赠与子女和其他人的相关税务问题

        （本文根据CIBC银行的一篇文章改编，没有任何高深复杂的内容，不过解答了一些客户的问题，本文没有讨论kiddie
        tax attribution rule 和 related party 资产转移等情况）
        <br /><br />
        大部分加拿大人都曾经考虑过为孩子赠与金钱或者其他礼物，最近CIBC对3,021名随机选择的加拿大成年人进行的民意调查发现，大多数（76％）加拿大父母对年龄在18岁或以上的孩子会给予一些经济上的帮助来帮助他们搬出家门，结婚，买房等等。<br /><br />然而，一旦你决定赠与，下一个问题是你应该给多少钱，你的礼物应采取什么形式，税收是多少，在某些情况下，还需要考虑跟礼物相关的家庭法的因素。<br /><br />现金可能是礼品的最常见方式，但您也可以考虑以“实物”形式赠送财产，例如，把你持有的证劵或者房子给到孩子。 <br /><br />加拿大一般没有规定限制你可以给予多少，无论是在你的一生中还是在你死亡时，你可以尽可能多地给予，但一定要确保赠与的财产不是自己维持生活所必须的或者日后会用到的资产。毕竟给予礼物的最大问题是很难将其取回。<br /><br />有两种主要类型的礼物：“生活中的”(nter-vivos)礼物，意思是在你活着的时候给予的礼物，或者是在死后给予的“遗嘱”礼物。通过赠与礼物，您通常可以看到您的受益人享受您的礼物，甚至可能有节省税收的机会。<br /><br />民意调查发现，许多加拿大人对与捐赠有关的税收感到困惑，超过一半的人承认他们根本不知道给孩子或亲戚的经济礼物上有什么税，而近10％的人认为礼物是可能对收件人征税。
        <br /><br />虽然礼物本身确实是免税的，但重要的是要记住，根据赠送的内容可能会产生税收。当您以“实物”形式赠送资产时，例如证券或房地产，您通常会被视为您以公平市场价格出售了天赋财产，并且您将按50％的资本收益纳税。<br /><br />虽然礼品接收者不会对他们收到的礼品支付任何所得税，但是他将对所获得的任何跟赠与相关的未来收入纳税。这也为家庭提供收入分配和税款节约的机会<br /><br />例如，假设您以50％的边际税率缴纳税款，而您的成年女儿则以20％的边际税率缴纳税款。如果你向你的成年女儿赠送10万元的礼物并且她每年投入资金以赚取5％的收入，那么每年家庭的总体税收节省可能是1,500元：100,000元x 5％x（50％ - 20％分）。<br /><br />请注意，财政部长Bill Morneau提出的新的反收入分配规则并不影响这种类型的税收计划 - 父母向18岁以上的孩子提供礼物。新的规则旨在限制私人公司进行的各种收入分配策略，适用于成年亲属，如兄弟姐妹，儿童，叔叔，阿姨或侄女和侄子等等。<br /><br />
        由于大部分省份征收遗产管理税或遗嘱认证费，最高可达遗产资产的1.7％（取决于您所在的省份），因此赠与也可以为您节省一些税款。通过赠送资产，这些资产将不会被用来计算遗嘱认证费用，因为它们不属于您的遗产。<br /><br />将资产直接赠与时，通常会失去对资产的控制。如果您想对资产使用保持一定程度的控制的话，可以考虑建立信托。<br /><br />通过信托，您可以将资产转移给受托人，受托人将代表最终受益人（一般是孩子,家庭成员等）管理资产。通过信托协议，您可以指定受益人的分配时间和数额。这对于那些可能没有能力管理资金而又喜欢挥霍的受益人尤其有用。使用信托比直接给礼物更复杂，对应该寻求专门从事信托的律师或者会计师的建议，以确定信托是否适合你。<br /><br />在某些情况下，信托也可能有助于保护未来留给孩子的资产免受孩子目前债权人或配偶的索赔。事实上，如果父母想要帮助孩子购买房屋但希望保护这些资金的时候，父母会将“礼物”构建为贷款，并要求用房产作为抵押担保。这种抵押可以在以后某个日期或在死亡时取消。
